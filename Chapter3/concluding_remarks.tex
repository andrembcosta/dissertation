\section{Summary and conclusions}

This manuscript presents a new approach for developing model-based simulations of hydraulic fracturing. 
The method relies on a global problem that captures flow and deformation fields, and a local problem that captures crack growth with the aid of a phase-field method.  The two problems are coupled through the transfer of displacement and pressure fields, as well as updates to the crack geometry.  This multi-resolution approach allows the phase-field method to be used as a tool to update the crack geometry without the need to explicitly reconstruct the crack aperture from the diffuse representation.  

The accuracy of the multi-resolution approach is evaluated through several numerical examples. These include the well-known KGD problem, for which a good agreement with analytical solutions is obtained in both the toughness and viscosity regimes. A problem with a curved crack trajectory around a stiff inclusion also demonstrates the overall robustness of the approach.  Several areas for future work present themselves. These include, for example, an enhancement of the algorithm to identify the sharp crack tip from the diffuse damage field; treatment of problems involving crack branching and merging; three-dimensional geometries and crack nucleation in arbitrary locations.
