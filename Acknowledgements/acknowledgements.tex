\acknowledgements

I want to thank Professor Ilinca Stanciulescu, with whom I worked during my undergraduate years, for her patient guidance in my first research project. I want to thank Dr. Henrique Versieux, my Masters advisor, for introducing me to the theory of phase-field and the mathematical background that was very important to me in this Ph.D. I want to thank Professor John Dolbow, my advisor, for his valuable advice, barbecues and Thanksgiving dinners, and for proofreading several poorly written drafts of mine. I want to thank Professors Wilkins Aquino, Johann Guilleminot, Manolis Veveakis for their time and service as my committee members. Most of the work in this dissertation originated from their course projects. I want to thank Dr. Matteo Cusini, Dr. Fan Fei, Dr. Tao Jin and Dr. Randolph Settgast from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for many enlightening discussions. I want to thank my colleagues Dr. Gary Hu and Dr. Rudy Geelen for babysitting me during my first semesters as a graduate student. 

I also want to thank my mom Celia, dad Fernando and sister Julia for all the support in these difficult years away from home. As well as my girlfriend Leticia for going through so much time on a long-distance relationship and for all our daily calls over these years.
