\section{Numerical Examples}
\label{section: Chapter4/examples}

In this section, a set of example problems computed with the aforementioned method is presented. These examples illustrate the main capabilities of the approach, but also serve to demonstrate some of the limitations. They all consist of hydrulic fracture propagation in a poroelastic medium. However, different fracture geometries and boundary conditions are explored. The main goal is to ensure that the proposed algorithm works as expected and can handle different scenarios, such as multiple fractures and in-plane crack merging.

Importantly, a true verification procedure is not performed here. For example, mesh convergence studies and comparisons with well-known solutions are yet to be performed. Those require a few enhancements in the solver technology that are currently under development. First, due to the high discrepancy between the scales of degrees of freedom (matrix displacements, fracture apertures and pressures), general purpose linear solvers struggle to converge when the meshes are refined past a certain point. In this case, special preconditioners that take into account the block structure of the system are recommended. CITE SOMEONE. Second, analytical solutions for poroelastic problems are scarce, so, a common verification procedure consists in solving them with vanishing small permeability coefficients to verify convergence towards the KGD solutions (Section XXX) for impermeable media. However, as the permeability decreses, the poromechanics problem starts to display KBB-type instabilities (CITE SOMETHING), which require either modifications to element types or a stabilized formulation, such as (CITE JOSH PAPER). This solver infrastructure enhancements are currently in progress.

For the problems in this Section, the material properties used are listed in Table XX.

\subsection{Single fracture under fluid injection with non-homogenous boundary conditions}

In this problem, an initial penny-shaped fracture is injected with a viscous fluid and the boundary conditions are these shown in Figure XXX. Since the boundary conditions are different in the outer faces, the fracture tend to have a prefered propagation direction and therefore, loses its initial circular shape.

\subsection{Two parallel circular fractures under fluid injection}

In this problem, a pair of parallel penny-shaped fractures is stimulated with the injection of a viscous fluid. Parallel fractures are very common in real-world fracking, in general, fracking sites will have dozens, if not hundreds of parallel fractures, which are stimualted simultaneously.

Depending on the distance between the fractures, they may grow away from each other, forming a cup shaped geometry. This is a consequence of the interaction between the stress fields in the vicinity of the multiple fractures, this interaction is often called stress shadow effect.

In this numerical example shown here, the initial fractures are placed far from each other to prevent this nonplanar behavior. The far-field boundary conditions are assumed to be homogenous for pressures and tractions. Figure XX illustrates the setup. 

In this case, the fractures are expected to grow radially, preserving their circular shape. This feature is confirmed in the simulated results shown in Figure \ref{fig:parallel_snapshots}. In this figure, the right-side of the domain shows the pressure field computed in the global domain whereas the left side shows the discrete crack geometry, colored in gray scale indicating the aperture field. It also shows the subdomain around the crack front, colored by the damage field.

The aperture and pressure at the injection sources are important quantities in this type of problem and their simulated time series are shown in Figure \ref{fig:parallel_fracs_charts}. Due to the symmetry, both fractures have the same pressure and aperture results. The reference values used to make the curves nondimensional are listed in Table \ref{parallel_refs}.

\subsection{Merging two circular fractures}

The second problem deals with the case of in-plane fracture merging. In general, fracture merging is one of the most difficult behaviors to simulate with discrete fracture approaches. That is due to the interaction between the stress fields of two fracture fronts, which makes most attempts to extract a stress intensity factor innacurate. 

In these types of problems, the phase-field method becomes handy, allowing for the computation of crack advances regardless of the front geometry. This is explored well in the multi-resolution approach, since the entire fracture front is inside the subdomain by construction, allowing for the use of the phase-field solver. 

Since this problem deals with in-plane merging, getting the discrete fracture planes from the phase-field values is straightforward. However, it is important to mention that this can be a challenge in the case of non-planar merging.

The problem under consideration consists of two parallel fractures, initally of circular shape, embedded in a poroelastic matrix. Both are injected with a viscous fluid and propagate radially, eventually merging.  The simulated behavior is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:merge_snapshots}. As for the previous problem, the times series for the aperture and pressure in the injection point are shown in Figure \ref{fig:merging_charts}. The reference values used to make these charts nondimensional are given in Table \ref{merging_refs}.
