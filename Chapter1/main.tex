\label{section: Chapter1}

Fracture can be observed in virtually all engineering applications across several scales. It is important to understand the behavior of materials, components and structures with the presence of fracture. To that end, model-based simulations are widely adopted to help understand fracture-related phenomena. In the past two decades, variational approaches to fracture have become increasingly popular, among which gradient damage models and phase-field models have received the most attention. On the one hand, these models have been successfully applied to a variety of engineering problems involving brittle/quasi-brittle fracture, cohesive fracture, ductile fracture as well as their coupling with other physics. On the other hand, the development of the theoretical variational framework was mostly confined within the regime of brittle/quasi-brittle fracture. This dissertation is concerned with the gap between the fundamental variational framework and practical engineering applications.
