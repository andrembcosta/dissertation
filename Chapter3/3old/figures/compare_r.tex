  \caption[Response of the bar with a pressurized crack.]{Response of the bar with a pressurized crack. The phase-field regularization length is fixed to be \SI{5}{\milli\meter}. Different levels of mesh refinement are considered: (a-c) $l/h^e = 5$, (d-f) $l/h^e = 10$, (g-i) $l/h^e = 20$, (j-l) $l/h^e = 50$. The first column (a, d, g, j) shows the reaction force on the left symmetry plane; the second column (b, e, h, k) shows the reaction force on the right boundary where the displacement control is applied; the third column (c, f, i, l) shows the approximated pressure applied on the crack. For comparison purposes, all responses are plotted as a function of the prescribed displacement. }
