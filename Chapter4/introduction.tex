\section{Introduction}
\label{section: Chapter4/intro}

While two-dimensional simulations, based on the multi-resolution algorithm proposed in the previous chapter, can be useful to study fundamental processes in hydraulic fracturing, realistic systems are almost always three-dimensional. Therefore, an extension of the approach to 3D is certainly the most natural next step to be taken. 

This chapter then proposes a new propagation algorithm for the multi-resolution approach that is suited for planar fractures in three dimensions. This algorithm is implemented in the HPC solver GEOS \cite{settgast2012simulation,settgast2014simulation,settgast2017fully} in a fruitful collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 

The chapter begins with a brief recap of the multi-resolution algorithm and moves on to the detailed description of the new propagation algorithm for the case of planar fractures. Illustrative examples are then presented, including in-plane merging of two-penny shaped cracks. In the end, in Section \ref{section: Chapter4/nonplanar}, the extension to non-planar fractures in 3D is discussed, and the prototype of an algorithm is presented. A simplified version of this algorithm is implemented and tested in a 2.5D problem with a curved crack. While it addresses some of the challenges, it requires further work to handle the general case.
