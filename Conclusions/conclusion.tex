\section{Concluding Remarks}

This manuscript examines various models for phase-field fracture incorporating pressure loads on diffuse crack faces.  This includes the analysis of a new formulation that can be obtained by assuming that the pressure load does not act on the virtual extension of a crack, or alternatively through a careful accounting in the minimization procedure. The new formulation is referred to as the 
 ``unloaded virtual crack formulation"\eqref{uvc}. In order to verify the accuracy of the various models for propagating cracks, a new form of the J-Integral for pressurized cracks in the phase-field context is derived.

The \eqref{uvc} formulation proposed herein allows for a unified treatment of crack nucleation and propagation in scenarios involving either brittle or cohesive fracture, and provides for better accuracy in some problems compared to existing formulations of the \eqref{lvc} type. As it allows for the use of the same governing equation for the damage parameter, its computational implementation within existing phase-field solvers is also simpler. In future work, its applicability to problems involving plastic deformation and strength-based fracture nucleation will be studied. In addition to that, modifications to accelerate the convergence of the model with respect to the phase-field parameter $\ell$ will also be considered.

\section{Summary and conclusions}

This manuscript presents a new approach for developing model-based simulations of hydraulic fracturing. 
The method relies on a global problem that captures flow and deformation fields, and a local problem that captures crack growth with the aid of a phase-field method.  The two problems are coupled through the transfer of displacement and pressure fields, as well as updates to the crack geometry.  This multi-resolution approach allows the phase-field method to be used as a tool to update the crack geometry without the need to explicitly reconstruct the crack aperture from the diffuse representation.  

The accuracy of the multi-resolution approach is evaluated through several numerical examples. These include the well-known KGD problem, for which a good agreement with analytical solutions is obtained in both the toughness and viscosity regimes. A problem with a curved crack trajectory around a stiff inclusion also demonstrates the overall robustness of the approach.  Several areas for future work present themselves. These include, for example, an enhancement of the algorithm to identify the sharp crack tip from the diffuse damage field; treatment of problems involving crack branching and merging; three-dimensional geometries and crack nucleation in arbitrary locations.
